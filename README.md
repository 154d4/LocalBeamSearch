## Abstract

Our purpose is to apply parallel computing such as Java threading for optimizing the local beam search algorithm.
This project will demonstrate the introduction of the local beam search algorithm, and how to implement it by using Java.
As a result, the performance of parallel has improved by about 17 percent compared to the sequential algorithm.
